      "description": "It gives me great pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Xavier Lau. Xavier, a student in my drum kit course at Aureus Academy, has consistently shown exemplary abilities as a drummer and musician in general. He works extremely hard to succeed and be the greatest musician he can be, and the material he has mastered in class, the Rockschool Debut and Grade 1 syllabus, has been at a very high musical level. He is a fantastic musician for his grade, and he also always approaches the work we do in class with an outstanding attitude. Additionally, Xavier is jovial and enjoyable to work with. I wholeheartedly endorse Xavier for the DSA for this music-related CCA. He is an excellent student, demonstrates exceptional musicality, and I have no doubt that he will have a great professional future. Xavier will benefit from the DSA by being able  to continue his education as a secondary school student and musician, and there isn't a more worthy applicant. ",
